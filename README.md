🌞 SunChazer – Smart Solar-Tracking Rover

SunChazer is an intelligent, self-adjusting solar rover designed to capture maximum sunlight wherever it goes. Powered by real-time sensing and autonomous movement, it constantly searches, tracks, and aligns itself with the brightest source of energy.

🔆 1. Intelligent Sun Detection

SunChazer continuously measures light intensity using real-time voltage sensing. It instantly identifies where sunlight is strongest and begins scanning towards that direction.

🔄 2. Dual-Axis Precision Tracking

With two servos controlling horizontal and vertical rotation, the rover scans multiple angles to perfectly align its solar panel. This ensures higher efficiency compared to static or single-axis systems.

⚙️ 3. Automatic Panel Optimization

The system adjusts itself throughout the day, ensuring the panel always faces the most powerful sunlight without any manual control.

🚙 4. Autonomous Mobility

If sunlight drops due to shadows, obstacles, or changing environments, SunChazer activates its movement system. It moves forward, left, or right to find a brighter spot—making it fully self-sufficient.

🔋 5. Maximized Solar Efficiency Anywhere

Its smart tracking + mobility ensures SunChazer always positions itself for optimal solar output, making it ideal for learning, demonstrations, and clean-energy innovation.
